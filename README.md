# python_flask_website

My name is Leonard Martin and I am a Jr. Software Developer

I created a website using Python, Flask, HTML, and Javascript.

The purpose of the website is for a user to signup and write notes.

The user signs up using their name, email, and creating a password.

Once the user is signed up, they can login and logout.

Oncer the user logs in, they can write and delete notes.

The notes are stored on the display screen.

Also, the website implements a database that stores the user's login credentials.
